# Heat_Exchanger
MATLAB was used to code this program. 
This code calculates the volumes, center of mass, and torque for a shell and tube heat exchanger for two different cases. 
It starts by cleaning up previous data and defining global variables. 
It then computes the volume of the shell, tubes, and caps for both cases using symbolic integration in polar and Cartesian coordinates. 
After determining the total volume of oil in the heat exchanger, the code calculates the mass of oil and the center of mass along the x and z axes. 
Finally, it computes the torque along the x-axis for each case based on the calculated center of mass.
